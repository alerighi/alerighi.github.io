My personal website, complete of print functionality!

## Theme

The theme of the website is inspired to the glorious IBM AS/400 computer system, that I see 
still used in a multitude of companies. I adore the glorious text-only green screens, where 
the navigation is done with the function keys. Each time I see someone use one of them I stare
at him amazed!
