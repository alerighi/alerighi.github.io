        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm a software developer, currently completing my Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at the 
            University of Verona, where I was born and still live. 
        </p>
        <p>	
            As a child I always been curious about how things worked, for example I used to take 
            apart things to see what was inside them. I first had the passion about electronics, then I discovered 
            computers when my parents gave me an old PC to play with, take it apart, experiment with Linux, and 
            so on. Then I started programming at the age of 15, with the C programming language, and to satisfy my 
            curiosity I learned more and more things about programming, new languages, new tools, new libraries, etc. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I didn't choose an high school oriented at computer science, but I rather choose the classic Scientific Lyceum, 
            where I studied subjects like latin and philosophy, but I also studied very well math and physics. Then in 2015 
            I decided to study Computer Science at the University of Verona, where I graduated in 2018 with 110 with honneurs.
            Now I'm continuing my studies in Verona with a Master's degree and I plan to graduate in 2020. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I support the free and open source software (FOSS), in particular I am a GNU/Linux enthusiast, and I 
            feel at home in a UNIX shell. I like doing jobs as a system administrator, installing and configuring 
            software, maintaining servers, configuring networks, virtual machines, creating databases, and so on. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I really like coding, in particular I know different programming languages, raging from low level system 
            languages like C, C++ or Rust to high level languages like Java, Python, JavaScript. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I also have good competence in algorithms and data structures, in particular on how to design efficient algorithms to solve 
            real life problems. In that regard I participate at programming contests, like for example the ACM ICPC and 
            Google HashCode, where in 2019 my team qualified for the global final round. For my passion about competitive 
            programming since 2018 I'm working as a tutor at the trainings of the Italian Olympiad in Informatics.
