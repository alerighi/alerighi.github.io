        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! I'm a computer science student, currently completing a Master's degree at the 
            University of Verona. 
        </p>
        <p>	
            I live in <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=san%20pietro%20in%20cariano#map=16/45.5198/10.8886" title="Map">San Pietro in Cariano</a>, a beautiful village in the Valpolicella countryside, home of famous 
            Italian wines like Amarone and Recioto. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As a child I was really courious, I had to know how things worked, I liked to take apart stuff and always had a 
            screwdriver in my hands. Then my parents gave me a computer, so I started tinkering around with it, installed Linux on it, and then started 
            programming. And I instantly fell in love with it, I had the power to make my computer do exactly what I tell him to do. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>But don't worry! I also like other things, hanging out with friends, doing sports, music, litterature, politics, I'm not the boring nerd that I may appear!</i>
        </p>
        <h2>IT KNOWLEDGE</h2>
        <p>
            I know very well GNU/Linux operatings systems, in fact I'm a huge free software supporter. I used practically every distribution, 
            and now setteled with ArchLinux, and I feel at home in a shell. I like being a systemd administrator, 
            managing servers, configuring networks, writing shell scripts, configuration files, and other stuff. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm also good at coding, I know a lot of programming languages: Rust, C, C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, shell scripting. 
            My favourite nowadays is Rust, that I'm starting to use for practically every project. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I also have competences in SQL databases, building REST or GraphQL APIs, building backends for web applications, 
            and a little of frontend programming.  
        </p>
        <p>
            I also have good competences in algorithms and data structures. In that regard I participate at programming contests, 
            last year I partecipated at the SWERC ICPC regionals in Paris and at the Google HashCode word finals in Dublin. 
        </p>
        <h2>WORK EXPERIENCE</h2>
        <p>
            Since 2018 I work for the Italian Olympiad in Informatics team, as a tutor at the trainings that are held during the 
            year and as a software developer. The main project that we are developing now is TuringArena, a new platform to host 
            programming contests. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I work as a tutor in my university, to help first year students that are approaching programming for the first 
            time. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I also developed a lot of personal project, that can be found on my GitHub page. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As a non-IT related jobs, I help my father with his vineyards, in particular with the harvest. Time to time I 
            appreciate doing a job outside, that doesn't consist in sitting down in front of a keyboard all day.
