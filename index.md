## ABOUT ME

I'm a curios person, passionate about anything technical, always wanting to learn 
new things. I love to solve real-world problems with elegant, simple, reliable solutions.

I got a masters's degree in computer science and engineering at the 
[University of Verona](https://www.di.univr.it), where I also got a bachelor's degree in computer science.

Since 2020 I work as a software engineer at [Iotinga](https://iotinga.it), primarily in
the field of connected IoT devices. Here I can confront myself with challenging and 
stimulating projects, improving and learning new things everyday.

I'm interested in cybersecurity and I participated at the 2020 national cybersecurity 
challenge [CyberChallenge.IT](https://cyberchallenge.it)), where I qualified first at 
the local selection and, with the team of my university, 3rd at the national finals. 
I'm now an instructor and I organize the local training for the University of Verona venue.

I also participated in competitive programming contests, most notably with my team <q>UniVR be || !be</q> 
I qualified 21th at the Google Hashcode 2019 world finals in Dublin.
I worked as a tutor for the [Italian Olympiad in Informatics](https://olimpiadi-informatica.it) till 2022.
        
Finally, I'm an hobbyist, I like doing DIY projects, fixing things, tearing them apart to see how they
are built, hacking and modifying stuff to make it better and to recycle components that otherwise would 
have gone in the dumpster.
