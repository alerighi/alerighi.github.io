## ABOUT ME

I'm an Information Engineer, passionate about anything technical, always wanting to learn 
new things. I love to solve real-world problems with elegant, simple, reliable solutions.

When I was a child I always had a screwdriver in my hands, taking apart devices to see 
how they work. I was the child that used to fix the technical issue of my parents.

I then studied Computer Science and Engineering at [University of Verona](https://www.di.univr.it), 
where I also got first a bachelor's and then master's degree.

In 2020 I started working as a software engineer in [Iotinga](https://iotinga.it), a 
young company specialized in IoT and IIoT devices. Here I did confront myself with
challenging and stimulating projects, improving and learning new things everyday.
I'm now holding a position as an Applied Research Director at the same company.

One of my passions is cybersecurity: I participated at the 2020 national cybersecurity 
challenge [CyberChallenge.IT](https://cyberchallenge.it)), where I qualified first at 
the local selection and, with the team of my university, 3rd at the national finals. 
I'm now one of the main organizers of the initiative at the University of Verona venue.

In the past I also participated in competitive programming contests, most notably with 
my team I qualified 21th at the Google HashCode 2019 world finals in Dublin.
I worked as a tutor for the [Italian Olympiad in Informatics](https://olimpiadi-informatica.it) till 2022.
        
Finally, I'm an hobbyist, I like doing DIY projects, fixing things, tearing them apart to see how they
are built, hacking and modifying stuff to make it better and to recycle components that otherwise would 
have gone in the dumpster.

and finally my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/alerighi)!
