## ABOUT ME

Hi! I'm a computer science student, currently completing a Master's degree at 
the University of Verona.

I live in [San Pietro in Cariano](https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=san%20pietro%20in%20cariano#map=16/45.5198/10.8886), 
a beautiful village in the Valpolicella
countryside, home of famous Italian wines like Amarone and Recioto.

As a child I was really curious, I had to know how things worked, I liked to
take apart stuff and always had a screwdriver in my hands. Then my parents gave
me a computer, so I started tinkering around with it, installed Linux on it, 
and then started programming. And I instantly fell in love with it, I had the
power to make my computer do exactly what I tell him to do. 

*But don't worry! I also like other things, hanging out with friends, doing 
sports, music, litterature, politics, I'm not the boring nerd that I may appear!*

## IT KNOWLEDGE

I know very well GNU/Linux operating systems, in fact I'm a huge free software 
supporter. I used practically every distribution, and now settled with ArchLinux
(in reality on my laptop I switched to Parabola GNU/Linux, a 100% free software 
distribution), and I feel at home in a shell. I don't indeed particularly like 
graphical user interfaces, in fact in my computer I use i3 as a windows manager and
only CLI programs, with the exception of the web browser, Firefox, for which I have 
a plugin to use vim key bindings ;-).

I like being a systemd administrator, managing servers, configuring networks, 
writing shell scripts, configuration files, managing databases, and even installing,
configuring or repairing hardware (I like using a soldering iron).

I'm also good at coding, I know a lot of programming languages: Rust, C, C++, Python,
Java, JavaScript, shell scripting. My favorite historically was C, but now I'm 
starting to use Rust, and I like it.

I also have competences in SQL databases, building REST or GraphQL APIs, building 
backends for web applications, and a little of frontend programming, even if I don't
like doing that. 

I also have good competences in algorithms and data structures. In that regard 
I participate at programming contests, last year I participated at the SWERC ICPC 
regional in Paris and at the Google HashCode word finals in Dublin.

## WORK EXPERIENCE

Since 2018 I work for the Italian Olympiad in Informatics team, as a tutor at the 
trainings that are held in Volterra. There I have the opportunity to confront myself
with other persons like me, work on projects, learn new things. 

I work as a tutor in my university, last year I was a tutor for the source 
*Laboratory of Programing* for math freshmen, this year I'm a tutor for the
courses *Programming I* for Bioinformatics students and *Programming II 
and software engineering* for Informatics students.  

At my university I'm also one of the organizer of the initiative *Programming 
Challenges*, that consists in a space where students with the passion of 
programming can meet, learn new things, train to participate in programming 
contests, and work on group projects.

I also developed a lot of personal project, that can be found on my GitHub page. 

As a non-IT related jobs, I help my father with his vineyards, in particular 
with the harvest. I appreciate doing a job outside, that doesn't consist in sitting 
down in front of a screen all day.

(or [here](https://alerighi.github.io/cv/cv.it.pdf) in Italian).

I'm currently looking around for a job, since I completing my studies, so job offers are very welcome!
