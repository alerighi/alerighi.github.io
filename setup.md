title: My computing setup
layout: defualt

I have two main computers that I use:
- a desktop computer that I built years ago, that has an i7 3770k 
  processor, 8Gb of RAM and a 500Gb SSD. It's old but gets the job done.</li>
- a lenovo thinkpad t440p that I recently bought on Ebay for nearly nothing,
  it has an i5, 8Gb of ram and 250Gb SSD, and a great keyboard</li>

I also have a Raspberry Pi model 3+ that I use as a home server, and as a router 
and DNS/DHCP server for my LAN. 

In the past I had a macbook pro 15, but I stopped using it since I don't
want to use proprietary software anymore. Plus in the last updates Apple
locked down more and more the operating system, rendering it unusable for
me. For example is incredibly difficult installing third party non signed
applications, and you no longer can use tools like gdb or valgrind.

Now I use GNU/Linux on all these systems, especially I use Arch Linux, in
reality on on the laptop I use Parabola GNU/Linux, a 100% free software 
distribution. I find ArchLinux a good distribution, but I want to switch
again to Gentoo that I used in the past, when I have time, since I like the
fact that doesn't force you to use SystemD. 

I don't particularly like GUIs, and I do most of my work in the terminal. 
Because of that, I don't use a desktop environment, they are big, waste 
a lot of resources and for me are more difficult to use with all their 
menus and icons. I use a simple window manager, that is i3. As a terminal
emulator I use urxvt.

I like minimalism in software: software that is small, well writteng and gets
the job done without too many complications. I don't care if the software 
looks nice, I want it to be robust, be usable and work reliably.

As a text editor I use vim, that I'm also using to write this HTML document.
I tried to use Emacs in the past but I found it too coplex, plus the keyboard
shortcuts are not simple to type. I do most of my editing in vim, with the 
exception of working on large projects, for which I use IntelliJ Community 
Edition, especially for Rust project since it has a very good plugin for it. 

As a browser I use Firefox, or Iceweasel that is the 100% free software version
of Firefox. I'm considering switching for a simpler browser, that is not that
bulky, but all of them seems based on Chromium and I don't like that. Also I
use Firefox as a password manager and it works great.

As a music payer, I user mpd (Music Player Daemon), that I can start in the 
background and control with multiple frontends, so even if I end my X session
music continues playing. I use ncmpcpp as a ncursess frontend of mpd.

As a programming language I like C, but nowadays I also use Rust a lot, and 
I like it, even if most Rust software uses too many dependency and thus is 
bloated.

I have an Android phone, that is a Xiami mi9, but I don't like it very much,
especially since the operating system is proprietary and it's not simple to
change. I'm considering changing it with a phone that runs LineageOS natively,
but even then I have the problem that a lot of applications requires Google
Services to run. Or I get rid of the mobile phone and solve the problem at its
roots, that would be the best solution.

I have social media account but I'm considering deliting them. By the way I 
don't use them a lot, so it wouldn't change a lot getting rid of them. For my
communications I mostly use Telegram, even if I would have personally choosen
Signal that is more secure and it's free software, but unfortunately nobody in
my contacts uses it.
