Today I wanted to do a simple operation. 

I have an email address from my university that once I used to register a 
Mathworks&trade;&reg; account to use the free student license to get MATLAB&trade;&reg;. 

They time to time (i.e. every week) send me an email announcing that the 
new fancy version of MATLAB&trade;&reg; is being released and that I 
should immediately try it out. 

I consider MATLAB a piece of garbage, that not only is a proprietary
software and that to me is unacceptable, but also it's a shitty programming
language for so many reason. If I would need to do calculation I would
probably stick with python, you know a language with a sane syntax. 

Since that, I decided that I wanted to delete my account. Sure, I could
have just ignored the emails or changed the preferences, but from now on
is a question of principle, I don't like Mathworks&trade;&reg; as a 
company and thus I don't want to be considered their customer. 

You would think that thanks to GDPR this operation would be easy, and I 
thought the same. I went into the account settings page to search for a
"delete this account" button, but I didn't found one. 

So obviously next step is to search on the web, surely I'm stupid and I'm
just missing the link, and again no luck, didn't found anything. 

Ok, but GDPR does give me the right to request a deletion of my personal 
information! Let's read the privacy policy. Interesting, there is a section
that states that to delete personal information you need to contact customer
service. Not so good, just to make it difficult to delete my account. 

I go to this section, insert my personal information (beside the fact that
I'm logged in with the fucking account that I want to delete!), submit the
request stating that I want to delete the account, since it's a right that 
GDPR gives me, insert ***again*** my name, insert ***again*** my email, and 
press confirm. 

They said that they sent me an email to confirm the request. I check my email
and found nothing. Mmmm let's check the spam folder, ah found it! Normally
of course emails regarding new versions of the software didn't go to spam, 
even if they **were** spam, but by chance an email regarding a stupid thing
like privacy informations will go to spam. Ok. 

Now let's wait 30 days and see if somebody will respond me.
