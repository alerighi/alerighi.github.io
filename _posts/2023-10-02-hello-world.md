This is my first blog post. I hope to have the time and willingness to publish something on it. 

For the time being, enjoy the retro-theme inspired to the glorious IBM AS/400, that is still see 
used to this day in too much companies. Every time I see the green terminal screens I stare at them 
hypnotized, so much they are beautiful!
