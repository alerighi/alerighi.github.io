title: Why I stop using social media
---

I never liked social networks. I first created a Facebook account when I was in
middle school, and just for the good old flash games like Farmville (anyone 
remembers them?). 

It never saw much use, I had less than 100 "friends",
and that is considered few.
I never posted anything and use it only to follow a few pages and
nothing more, and to use the message functionality before everyone switched 
to WhatsApp/Telegram.

Two years ago I wanted to try out Instagram, since most of my friends had it. 
This time I even made a couple of posts time to time, and in the first
months of usage even made stories. Not that I was addicted, I had like 60 
followers. 

Yesterday I took the decision to delete my social accounts. Let's 
see why. 

First at all, for a technical reason. I'm a supporter of the free software 
movement, and the applications and services of Facebook are proprietary. Not
only that, but I like being in control of my data, and with Facebook (and cloud
services in general) you are not: if you read the term of services uploading 
some content on Facebook gives them a license to use your content practically as
they want. Also it's not possible to really delete some content that you posted,
even if you delete your account as I did I'm sure that my data is still there, 
just not shown to the public. 

Another reason is political. Facebook practices censorship of the content 
that he says that doesn't follow their guidelines. 
In my country for example the official page of the fascist party Casapound
was taken down. I'm not in any way endorsing that party, in fact I'm of the 
opposite ideology and I think that that party is illegal and should be closed. 
But I recon that Facebook shouldn't have the power to do political censorship,
since it's a private company under the influence of the USA government, and 
this sets a dangerous precedent. 

But the most important reason is about the social impact that this technologies
has on our lives and the way we have human interaction with other people.

You see, social media makes you depressed. They make you compare your life with
the one of others and feel bad. You follow the girl that you like 
and see that she has a perfect life, always having fun somewhere, continuing
to like her photos hoping that one day something will happen, but in fact nothing
will change magically if you don't do something. You see
people that gets thousands of likes and you maybe get 10 of them and feel bad. 
You see the (apparently) perfect life of other people and feel bad because yours is so 
boring and banal.

And they also waste your time. I've seen that even if I'm not a social addicted
when I'm outside and have nothing to do, maybe I'm waiting in line at the post
office, I take my phone out of the pocket and open Instagram, start watching
stories, but just like an habit, without thinking about it. Why?

Or you go in vacation somewhere and you are constantly thinking about shooting a 
good photo to share on Instagram to make your friend jealous that you are there 
and they are in an office working. I see people that go at a concert, ad a party,
at a restaurant, and they **have** to make a story about that. To me is nonsense.

Lastly, I think that there will be nothing that I'll miss out not having social
media, at least nothing that is important to my life. And without them I can
focus on important things on life rather than feeling bad for not having as many
likes as other people.
